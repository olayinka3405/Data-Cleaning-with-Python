## Summary
This project demonstrates my competence in Python for data transformation and extraction. Using an hotel booking dataset, I performed data cleaning, transformation, and visualization to prepare the data for further analysis in business intelligence tools like Power BI.

## Methodology
The methodology followed in this project includes:

1. Data Loading: Importing the dataset from a CSV file.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Reviewing the dataset's structure, summary statistics, and data types.
3. Data Cleaning: Identifying and handling missing values, converting data types, and ensuring data consistency.
4. Data Transformation: Adjusting and transforming the data to fit the requirements of Power BI.
5. Visualization: Using visualization tools to understand the distribution and missingness in the data.

## Potential Problem to Solve
A common issue in data analysis is dealing with incomplete or inconsistent datasets. For example, the hotel booking dataset has missing values and incorrect data types, making it challenging to derive meaningful insights. The objective was to clean this dataset to make it usable for further analysis in Power BI.

## How the Cleaned Data Can Be Used in Power BI for Further Analysis
Once the data is cleaned and transformed using Python, it can be exported as a CSV file or directly imported into Power BI. In Power BI, the clean data can be used to:

1. Create interactive dashboards and reports.
2. Perform advanced data analysis and visualize trends.
3. Generate actionable business insights to improve decision-making processes.
4. Conduct time-series analysis using the cleaned 'reservation_status_date' column.

By ensuring the data is accurate and complete, Power BI can effectively provide valuable insights and visualizations that drive strategic business decisions.
